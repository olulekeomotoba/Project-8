**TITLE;**  <br>
FDIC Failed Bank List

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**  <br>
The "FDIC Failed Bank List Analysis" repository contains a comprehensive bank failure analysis dashboard developed using Power BI. The project aimed to analyze bank failure data from multiple sources and present insights through intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards.

**OBJECTIVE:**  <br>
Evaluate the trends of FDIC Failed Bank List in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs). Identify trends, patterns and anomalies in the FDIC Failed Bank List data over time. Generate actionable insights to inform data-driven decision-making. Enhance data transparency and accessibiity for stakeholders.

**DATA EXTRACTION:**  <br>
Houses datasets extracted from FDIC's Failed Bank List and supplementary financial records. Contains cleaned and aggregated datasets used in the analysis.

**DATA CLEANSING:**  <br> 
The column distribution, column profile and column quality was elucidated from the view ribbon of the power query editor. This was done to ascertain and check for the possibility of errors, null values, empty spaces, data uniqueness and distinctiveness, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**DATA TRANSFORMATION**  <br>
Transformation was done on the already cleansed data. The data had a lot of issues and required thorough cleansing, formatting, styling and re-organisation. This was done with a very high level of professionalism in order to maintain the integrity and originality of the data. The Transformed Data was then saved and made ready for the data modelling.

**DATA MODELING:**  <br> 
Designed a robust data model, incorporating various tables, relationships, and calculated columns for analysis. Power BI's data modeling capabilities were used to create relationships between different datasets. Data hierachy and date table creation using DAX was done,enabling a holistic view of the organization's performance.

**VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS:**  <br> 
Created interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps, to represent key performance, trends, and regional comparisons. These visuals allowed for easy interpretation of Failed Bank trends. The core focus of the project was on analyzing FDIC's Failed Bank List data over time. This involved creating time-based visualizations to track changes, seasonality in various KPIs. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed over time to access the FDIC's Failed Bank List trends in the regions where the banks are sited.

**DASHBOARD CREATION:**  <br> 
Constructed a user-friendly dashboard presenting KPIs, FDIC's Failed Bank List trends, and performance metrics.
Filtering and Slicing: Implemented dynamic filtering and slicing options for users to drill down into specific data points. This dashboard was developed to present the insights in an intuitive and interactive manner thereby enabling users to gain a deep understanding of the global terrorism analysis.

**PROJECT OUTCOMES**  <br>

Clear Insights: The project provided a clear picture of how FDIC's Failed Bank List Analysis had performed over the specified time period. allowing stakeholderss to make informed decisions based on historical data.

Improved Decision-Making: The interactive Power BI dashboard empowered decision-makers to identify areas for improvement, allocate resources effectively, and set realistic performance targets.

Data Transparency: The project enhanced data transparency within the FDIC's Failed Bank List activities, making it easier for stakeholders at all levels to access and understand the FDIC's Failed Bank List data.

Data-Driven Culture: The project contributed to fostering a data-driven culture, emphasizing the importance of data analysis in strategic decision-making.

In conclusion, the "FDIC's Failed Bank List" project successfully harnessed the capabilities of Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. This project not only provided valuable historical target insights but also paved the way for a more data-informed approach to managing the terrorist operations.
